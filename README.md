# Smoke-Guard

<h2>Introduction :</h2> This system is designed to detect and monitor smoking activities in food premises, where smoking is prohibited under Malaysian law. It uses a pre-trained activity recognition model that watches live video from a camera to spot if someone is smoking. When smoking is detected, the system sends an alert with a sound and logs the time of the event. 

<h2>Tools :</h2> 1) resnet-34_kinetics.onnx : pre-trained deep learning model used for activity recognition<br>
2) action_recognition_kinetics.txt : file contains the labels for activity recognition
